# Credit Risk Assessment & Model Validation for Retail Banking

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world retail banking use case where historical loan data is analyzed to assess credit risk and predict the probability of loan default. The solution follows an end-to-end analytics lifecycle, starting from business understanding to model validation and documentation.

The objective is to support data-driven credit decision-making by building and validating a statistical risk model.

## Business Problem
Traditional credit evaluation processes often rely on manual judgment, leading to inconsistent risk assessment and higher default rates. Financial institutions require a robust, data-driven approach to evaluate borrower risk and improve loan approval decisions.

---

## Solution Approach
1. Business requirement analysis and scope definition  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Credit risk model development using Logistic Regression  
5. Model validation using statistical performance metrics  
6. Interpretation of results for business decision-making

## Model Validation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- ROC-AUC score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification threshold analysis  

These metrics ensure the reliability and stability of the risk predictions.

---

## Outcome
The project delivers a validated credit risk model that can be used to classify customers based on default probability and support informed credit approval decisions.
