# Model Validation Report
## Credit Risk Assessment Model

---

## 1. Objective
To evaluate the performance, stability, and reliability of the credit risk model developed for predicting loan default probability.

---

## 2. Validation Methodology
The model was validated using statistical performance metrics commonly applied in financial risk modeling.

---

## 3. Validation Metrics
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Threshold Analysis

---

## 4. Results Summary
- The model demonstrated strong discriminatory power between default and non-default cases.
- ROC-AUC score exceeded the defined success threshold.
- Confusion matrix indicated balanced performance across classes.

---

## 5. Model Stability
The model showed consistent performance across different data segments, indicating acceptable stability for analytical use cases.

---

## 6. Limitations
- Performance dependent on historical data quality
- Does not account for macroeconomic factors
- Designed for analytical demonstration, not production deployment

---

## 7. Conclusion
The credit risk model meets the defined validation criteria and is suitable for supporting data-driven credit risk assessment and decision-making.
